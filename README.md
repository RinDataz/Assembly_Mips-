# Assembly_Mips-
Assembly Project, second year , MIPS


Project Requirements
1. The program must print a statement telling what the program can do. Do NOT repeat this 
statement.
2. Display a menu of choices and prompt the user for a selection.
3. Store the number entered by the user in a variable so that it may be retrieved and converted by 
the program to display the appropriate results.
4. Divide the program's tasks into manageable subroutines (Procedures).
5. All output should go to the screen using proper formatting techniques (spacing and blank lines 
as needed).
6. The program must accept up to 32 binary digits, eight hexadecimal digits, and integer numbers 
up to 4294967295. This will require using the data type "dword" and 32 bit registers.
7. If the user enters invalid data (a number too big, not the correct type of number, etc), then the 
program must give an appropriate error message and then ask the user to enter a valid number.
8. If the user enters lower case alpha character (for the HEX numbers), convert them to uppercase 
before displaying the output.
9. The output should display all three forms of the number (see the sample run). Any HEX number 
beginning with a letter must be preceded with a zero (0). Ex. 0A1B2
